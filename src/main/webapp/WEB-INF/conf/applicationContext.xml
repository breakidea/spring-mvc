In this case, its not        very useful as there is only one servlet in use. If        there were        multiple servlets in use, then shared beans could be defined here to        make configuration simpler.        It is also        useful as a central place        to import configurations. Eg        security config, database config, etc.        Imports the following        configuration files: - security-context.xml    </description>    <bean id="filterProxy" class="net.io.config.support.HttpFilter">        <property name="encoding" value="UTF-8" />        <property name="forceEncoding" value="true" />    </bean></beans>
